My postdoctoral work explores how recruiters and other talent acquisition professionals use technology and AI and integrate these tools into their routine professional practice.

In this project I have conducted 20+ qualitative interviews with recruiters and other talent acquisition professionals to understand their routine professional practices, their everyday use of technology, and how they are integrating AI into their everuday professional practice. Emergent themes from these interviews involve a desire for automation of clerical tasks, while also being concerned over automated decision making around candidates. Recruiters are skeptical of the AI hype that has innundated human resources technology, and tend to rely on AI tools for research into job roles (e.g., alternate titles for job roles, geographic-specific research), and tone modulation when corresponding with job candidates.

Informed by qualitative interviews with recruiters, our current project is a series of design workshops around the iterative construction of a database of available human resources technology (HR Tech) tools that touch recruiting processes. We are focused on building a database that focuses on practice-specific AI transparency concerns for recruiters and other talent acquisition professionals, including details about AI integration, automation, and ranking of various candidates. These design workshops have involved persona activities, interactive feedback, participatory design, and user walkthroughs.

This project is at the University of Virginia's [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/) and is supervised by [Dr. Mona Sloane](https://www.monasloane.org/sloane-lab) in the Sloane Lab in collaboration with the [Darden School of Business](https://www.darden.virginia.edu/).
