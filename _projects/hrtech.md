My postdoctoral project is (currently) a one-year enterprise hosted at the University of Virginia's [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/) and is supervised by [Dr. Mona Sloane](https://www.monasloane.org/sloane-lab) in collaboration with the [Darden School of Business](https://www.darden.virginia.edu/). The project investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in human resources (HR), focusing on how discretionary decision-making, work processes, and identity are shaped by AI, particularly in HR and job candidate recruitment. Project focuses on issues of AI Fairness and Ethics, deploying ethnographic and interview-based research methodologies, as well collection and maintenance of a database in preparation for an algorithmic audit using data science methodology.
