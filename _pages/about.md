I am a PhD Candidate  at the University of Colorado at Boulder in Information Science. Formerly, I was at Syracuse University's iSchool, but moved when my advisor took a position at the University of Colorado.

My research seeks to uncover the impacts of online platforms on people’s sense of self and their creative work, develop community-driven solutions to improve the online platform experience for individual users and explore how people work to improve platform experiences in ways that push back against these cis-heteropatriarchal normative logics for themselves and others. Focusing on the routinized, everyday work of people who make, share, and promote their creative work on online social platforms, I seek to understand how people draw on sociotechnical systems in daily routine to inform, hinder, and alter how they engage with their creativity, identities, communities, and the technical systems upon which they work.

I have published at top-tier peer reviewed computing venues, including first author papers at Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW), and the International Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP). My work has also been published in top peer-reviewed journals, including New Media and Society and Policy & Internet. **At GROUP ’23, I was awarded one of the two best paper awards given.** During my graduate studies, I have published eight full papers, four of which were first author papers – 6 in journals and 2 in conference proceedings. According to Google Scholar, as of August ’23, I have a citation count of 176 and an h-index of 5. My publications appear on syllabi at The University of Colorado Boulder, University College London, Northeastern University, The University of California Los Angeles, The University of Washington, and The TikTok Cultures Research Network Initiative.  My publications are listed [here](/publications/).

Information about my previous projects, including my books and screen writing, are listed on my [projects](/projects) page.
