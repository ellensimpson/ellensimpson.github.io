Carmilla is a love story told for queer women and developed by queer women. It started with a tweet shared between myself and producer Steph Ouaknine, and ran between 2014 and 2017. This sprawling transmedia storytelling experience has over 70 million views on YouTube, and is beloved by many in the LGBTQ+ community as one of the first examples of a lesbian story that does not bury their gays, and tells the story of a couple coming together and growing together. It is a fun thing I did during my twenties.

Summary: It has been five years since Laura and Carmilla vanquished the apocalypse and Carmilla became a bona fide mortal human. They have settled in to a cozy apartment in downtown Toronto; Laura continues to hone her journalism skills while Carmilla adjusts to a non-vampire lifestyle. Their domestic bliss is suddenly ruptured when Carmilla begins to show signs of "re-vamping" - from a fondness for bloody treats to accidental biting - while Laura has started having bizarre, ghostly dreams. The couple must now enlist their old friends from Silas University to uncover the unknown supernatural threat and save humanity - including Carmilla's.
