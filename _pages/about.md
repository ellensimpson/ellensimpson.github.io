I am a fourth year doctoral student at the University of Colorado at Boulder in Information Science. Formerly, I was at Syracuse University's iSchool.

My research is concentrated in human computer interaction and social computing. I focus on creatives and creative labor, exploring the relationships between creative work and platform logics. I am also interested in the mundane, everyday things people do as a part of their routine encounters with the world. My publications are listed [here](/publications/).

Information about my previous projects, including my books and screen writing, are listed on my [projects](/projects) page.
