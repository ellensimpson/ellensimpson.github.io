I am a PhD Candidate  at the University of Colorado at Boulder in Information Science. Formerly, I was at Syracuse University's iSchool, but moved when my advisor took a position at the University of Colorado.

My research seeks to uncover the impacts of online platforms on peopleâ€™s sense of self and their creative work, develop community-driven solutions to improve the online platform experience for individual users and explore how people work to improve platform experiences in ways that push back against these cis-heteropatriarchal normative logics for themselves and others. Focusing on the routinized, everyday work of people who make, share, and promote their creative work on online social platforms, I seek to understand how people draw on sociotechnical systems in daily routine to inform, hinder, and alter how they engage with their creativity, identities, communities, and the technical systems upon which they work. My publications are listed [here](/publications/). 

Information about my previous projects, including my books and screen writing, are listed on my [projects](/projects) page. To read a full draft of my research statement, please click [*here - document under construction*]
